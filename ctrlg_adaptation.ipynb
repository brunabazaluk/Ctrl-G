Question: For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 8%. For husbands that don't set the alarm and wives that set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 54%. For husbands that set the alarm and wives that don't set the alarm, the probability of ringing alarm is 41%.

For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon.

Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon.

       "      <td>Imagine a self-contained, hypothetical world with only the following conditions, and without any unmentioned factors or causal relationships. Question: We know that zuph and jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is not jyka. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use V2 to represent jyka. Use X to represent zuph. Use Y to represent glimx. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -&gt; var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Based on all the reasoning above, output &lt;YES&gt; or &lt;NO&gt; to answer the following question: Would an individual is not glimx if zuph instead of not zuph?</td>\n",

For husbands that set the alarm, the probability of alarm set by wife is 24%. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use X to represent husband. Use V2 to represent wife. Use Y to represent alarm clock. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables. Based on all the reasoning above, output <YES> or <NO> to answer the following question: If we disregard the mediation effect through wife, would husband positively affect alarm clock?   \n",

Question: We know that zuph or jyka causes glimx. We observed an individual is jyka. Guidance: Address the question by following the steps below:\\nStep 1) Extract the causal graph: Identify the causal graph thatdepicts the relationships in the scenario. Use V2 to represent jyka. Use X to represent zuph. Use Y to represent glimx. The diagram should simply consist of edges denoted in 'var1 -> var2' format, separated by commas. Step 2) Determine the query type: Identify the type of query implied by the main question. Choices include 'marginal probability', 'conditional probability', 'explainingaway effect', 'backdoor adjustment set', 'average treatment effect', 'collider bias', 'normal counterfactual question', 'average treatmenteffect on treated', 'natural direct effect' or 'natural indirect effect'. Your answer should only be a term from the list above, enclosed in quotation marks. Step 3) Extract all the available data. Your answer should contain nothing but marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities in the form 'P(...)=...' or 'P(...|...)=...', each probability being separated by a semicolon. Stick to the previously mentioned denotations for the variables.
